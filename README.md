# Shell
First assignment for CSE3320 (Operating Systems), which is about implementing about our shell program, mav shell (msh) similar to bourne shell (bash), c-shell (csh), or korn shell (ksh). It accepts commands, fork a child process and execute those commands. The shell will run and accept commands until the user exits the shell.
